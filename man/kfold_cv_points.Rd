\title{Split a given matrix X into k-folds}
\usage{
kfold_cv_points(x, folds = 3, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{N times p matrix of predictive variables.}

\item{folds}{Default<-3. Integer number indicating number of folds}

\item{seed}{Default<-NULL. Seed for the random generator number.}
}
\value{
A list containing two inside lists, one for training and one for testing. The length of the inside lists is equal to the number of folds
}
\description{
Splits a given matrix X into k-folds. This function keeps the dimensions of
the original X in both train and test and substitutes the values on either
division by NAs
