\title{Split points of a given matrix X into train / test}
\usage{
train_test_split_points(x, train_pct = NULL, train_size = NULL, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{N times p matrix of predictive variables.}

\item{train_pct}{Float number indicating the \% of rows used for training}

\item{train_size}{Integer number indicating number of rows used for training. train_size is superseded by train_pct}

\item{seed}{Seed for the random generator number. Parameter included for reproducibility purposes. Default is NULL (meaning no seed is assigned).}
}
\value{
a list containing a matrix x_train and a matrix x_test
}
\description{
Split points of a given matrix X into train / test based on parameters
train_pct and train_size. If both are informed train_pct takes preference.
This function keeps the dimensions of the original X in both train and test
and substitutes the values on either division by NAs
