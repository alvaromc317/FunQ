\title{Split a given matrix X into train / test}
\usage{
train_test_split(
  x,
  criteria = "points",
  train.pct = NULL,
  train.size = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{N times p matrix of predictive variables.}

\item{criteria}{Criteria used to divide the data. Valid values are 'rows', which considers the division based on full rows, or 'points', which considers the division based on points within the matrix.}

\item{train.pct}{Float number indicating the \% of rows used for training}

\item{train.size}{Integer number indicating number of rows used for training. train.size is superseded by train.pct}

\item{seed}{Seed for the random generator number. Parameter included for reproducibility purposes. Default is NULL (meaning no seed is assigned).}
}
\value{
a list containing a matrix x_train and a matrix x_test
}
\description{
Splits a given matrix into a train / test split based on two posible
criterias: either based on the total number of rows or the total number of
data points.
}
\examples{
# Generate a small matrix
x = matrix(rnorm(50), nrow=10)

# Divide based on full rows
train_test_rows = train_test_split(x, criteria='rows', train.pct=0.5)
x_train = train_test_rows$x_train
x_test = train_test_rows$x_test

train_test_points = train_test_split(x, criteria='points', train.pct=0.5)
